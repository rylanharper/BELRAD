# Gridsome Shopify

> A Gridsome e-commerce starter based on Shopify

This starter template is based off of the [Extended Shopify Starter for Gridsome](https://github.com/thetre97/gridsome-starter-shopify) by [Travis Reynolds](https://github.com/thetre97). Thanks for the help!

## ‚ú® Features

- Synced products + collections via Shopify
- Full account functionality + password reset
- Persisted account/cart storage
- Custom page transitions via gsap
- A simple Vue template structure for quick prototyping
- BEM CSS naming system using Tailwind's `@apply` method

## üõí Shopify Setup

1. Create a private app within your Shopify storefront and make sure all permissions are selected. This starter needs these permissions in order to enable account functionality.

2. In order to handle password reset correctly, you will need to first set up the following redirect `<script>` in your `theme.liquid` within Shopify:
```js 
var l = window.location;
if (/^\/a\//.test(l.pathname));
else {
  var href = "your-site-domain.com";
  l.pathname && (href += "/" + l.pathname), l.has && (href += l.hash), l.search && (href += l.search), href = href.replace("//", "/"), window.top.location.href = "https://" + href
}
```

3. Next, go to `Settings > Notifications > Customer account password reset` and replace the `<a>` tag with:
```bash
{% assign url_parts = customer.reset_password_url  | split: '/' %}
<a href="https://your-site-domain.com/account/reset?id={{url_parts[5]}}&token={{url_parts[6]}}" class="button__text">Reset your password</a>
```

4. Lastly, make sure to populate your storefront with products and collections. Both products and collections must have titles, descriptions, and images. It is also recommended that products have prices, tags, and product-types filled out as well. If you recieve an error upon start up, this is likely the reason. 

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Installation

1. Create a `.env` with your Storefront name and token. Note that the `.env` variables are prefixed with `GRIDSOME_` in order to make them available to apollo client (this is required): 
```
GRIDSOME_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT='your-shop-name'
GRIDSOME_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_TOKEN='your-storefront-token'
```
2. Install the dependencies:
```
npm install # or yarn
```
3. Start up the project:
```
npm run dev
```

## üëÄ Some Extra Tips
<details>
<summary><strong>Why are you using extracted component classes (BEM) with Tailwind?</strong></summary>

Templates using Tailwind can be overwhelming when starting off.. I find that using Tailwind's `@apply` is an excellent way to get all the benefits of writing in utility class shorthand, but without having to sift through all your javascript logic to adjust styles.

<summary><strong>How does the related products section work?</strong></summary>

For the related products section, I am using the [Gridsome Recommender Plugin](https://github.com/mklueh/gridsome-plugin-recommender) by [Marian Kl√ºhspies](https://github.com/mklueh). Go ahead and read over that plugin's documentation. You will find the options within the `gridsome.config.js` file. I recommend setting the `field` to either `title` or `productType` to get the best results within the plugin's options. If you need more or less relations (recommendations), you can edit the `maxRelations` option.

<details>
<summary><strong>Why do all the collection links point to the same collection?</strong></summary>

I only have one example collection in the demo site, so clicking the links within the shop menu will bring you to the same collection every time. In order to change this, just edit the link data within the `shop-menu.vue` component.
