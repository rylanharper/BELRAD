> Headless ecommerce with Vue, Sanity, and Shopify!

This starter template is based off of the [Extended Shopify Starter for Gridsome](https://github.com/thetre97/gridsome-starter-shopify) by [Travis Reynolds](https://github.com/thetre97). Thanks for the help!

## ‚ú® Features

- Dynamic content powered by Sanity!
- Synced products + collections via Shopify
- Full account functionality + password reset
- Persisted account/cart storage
- Custom page transitions via gsap
- A simple Vue template structure for quick prototyping
- BEM CSS naming system using Tailwind's `@apply` method

## ü¶Ñ Sanity Setup

1. First setup the Sanity studio:
```
cd /studio

npm install # or yarn

sanity init

# Select project to use: Create new project
# Your project name: Whatever you like!
# Use the default dataset configuration? Y
```

2. Deploy your GraphQL schema:
```
sanity graphql-deploy
```

3. Now you need to populate all the fields within the studio and create at least one page document type. I set up custom page scripts within the `web/scripts/pages` folder. You can add as many documents as you want... just make sure to follow a similar structure as the current `page.js` document type and then add them to `gridsome.server.js`.

## üõí Shopify Setup

1. Create a private app within your Shopify storefront and make sure all permissions are selected. This starter needs these permissions in order to enable account functionality.

2. In order to handle password reset correctly, you will need to first set up the following redirect `<script>` in your `theme.liquid` within Shopify:
```js 
var l = window.location;
if (/^\/a\//.test(l.pathname));
else {
  var href = "your-site-domain.com";
  l.pathname && (href += "/" + l.pathname), l.has && (href += l.hash), l.search && (href += l.search), href = href.replace("//", "/"), window.top.location.href = "https://" + href
}
```

3. Next, go to `Settings > Notifications > Customer account password reset` and replace the `<a>` tag with:
```bash
{% assign url_parts = customer.reset_password_url  | split: '/' %}
<a href="https://your-site-domain.com/account/reset?id={{url_parts[5]}}&token={{url_parts[6]}}" class="button__text">Reset your password</a>
```

4. There are a few "gotchas" in order for this project to work properly... First you must enable product metafields by going to `Settings > Metafields > Products` and creating a color metafield type. Once you create a product, scroll to the bottom to add in a metafield color swtach. You aslo need to make sure products that have a variety of colors all have the same name and a `productType` that matches that name of that product. Make sure you edit the URL handle (under the product's SEO section) to add in the color at the end of the url such as `your-product-name-light-blue`, etc.

5. Lastly, make sure to populate your storefront with products and collections. Make sure that your collections and products have titles, descriptions, and an image(s). Within your Products, add in prices, tags, product-types, and metafields. If you recieve an error upon start up, this is likely the reason. 

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Installation

1. Create a `.env` with your Storefront name and token. Note that the `.env` variables are prefixed with `GRIDSOME_` in order to make them available to apollo client (this is required): 
```
GRIDSOME_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT='your-shop-name'
GRIDSOME_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_TOKEN='your-storefront-token'
```
2. Install the dependencies:
```
npm install # or yarn
```
3. Start up the project:
```
npm run dev
```

## üëÄ Some Extra Tips
<details>
<summary><strong>Why are you using extracted component classes (BEM) with Tailwind?</strong></summary>

Templates using Tailwind can be overwhelming when starting off.. I find that using Tailwind's `@apply` is an excellent way to get all the benefits of writing in utility class shorthand, but without having to sift through all your javascript logic to adjust styles.

<details>
<summary><strong>How do the color swatches/related products work?</strong></summary>

For the related products section, I am using the [Gridsome Recommender Plugin](https://github.com/mklueh/gridsome-plugin-recommender) by [Marian Kl√ºhspies](https://github.com/mklueh). Go ahead and read over that plugin's documentation. You will find the options within the `gridsome.config.js` file. I recommend setting the `field` to either `productType` to get the best results within the plugin's options. If you need more or less relations (recommendations), you can edit the `maxRelations` option.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why do all the collection links point to the same collection?</strong></summary>

I only have one example collection in the demo site, so clicking the links within the shop menu will bring you to the same collection every time. In order to change this, just edit the link data within the `shop-menu.vue` component.
